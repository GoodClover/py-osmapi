PY-OSMAPI
=========
A OSM-Edit API Interface written in Python

Description
============
This Project is forked from repository osmate_ I saw the need to write my own code to access the OSM-API for editing.
My second requirement was to be able to use OAuth which I haven't found In any other Python OSM-API yet.


.. _osmate: https://github.com/jonycoo/osmate

Installation
=============
Sorry I haven't yet put the code in a package on PIP but I plan to do it.
If someone knows how, I appreciate help.
The only non-standard dependency is dateutil and rauth (for OAuth).
